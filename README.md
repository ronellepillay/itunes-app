# HyperionDev Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Level 3 Task 4 - Capstone Project - iTunes Media Search Application

## Overview

This project stands as the culmination of the Level 3 Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The primary goal is to craft a media search application that interfaces with the iTunes Store API. This API-driven app retrieves an array of media items, encompassing songs, movies, podcasts, and more. Users are empowered to initiate searches, explore search outcomes, and compile a personalized list of favorites.

### Technology Stack

This endeavor leverages the subsequent technologies:

HTML
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
JavaScript (ECMAScript 2021)
React Library
Node.js
Express Framework
Bootstrap Framework

## Setup Instructions

To embark on this project, adhere to the ensuing guidelines:

## step 1 : Backend Setup

1. Obtain and transfer the 'itunesapp' directory to your local workstation.
2. Launch the command line interface and navigate to the 'itunesapp' directory (e.g., cd c:/itunesapp).
3. Deploy the essential dependencies by executing 'npm install' within the command line interface.
4. Following the completion of the installation, initiate the application with 'npm start'.

## step 2 : Frontend Setup

5. Navigate to the "/frontend" directory within the "itunesapp" folder. For instance, utilize the command: cd c:/itunesapp/frontend.
6. Establish the indispensable frontend dependencies via 'npm install' in the command line interface.
7. Upon the successful installation, launch the frontend with 'npm start'.
8. Both the backend and frontend servers are now operational.
9. Access http://localhost:3000 through your web browser to preview the project.

## User Guidelines for the iTunes App

1. Upon launching the project in your preferred web browser at http://localhost:3000, you will encounter a search bar atop the interface, accompanied by a catalog of search outcomes underneath. Adjacently, a "Favorites" section is present on the right-hand flank.

### Search Functionality

2. To initiate a search for music, movies, or other media categories within the iTunes Store, furnish your search query (1) within the designated search bar. Next, opt for the desired media category (2) to narrow down your search. If no specific category is chosen, the search will encompass all media types. The available alternatives span movies, podcasts, music, audiobooks, short films, TV shows, software, and ebooks. Once your preferences are set, finalize the process by clicking the "Search" button.

### Add a Favourite

3. To include a particular search result to your "Favorites" compilation on the right-hand panel, engage the "Add Favorite" button adjacent to the preferred song or movie from the search results collection.
4. Witness the selected media becoming a part of your "Favorites" inventory on the right-hand segment of the interface.

### Delete a Favourite

5. To eliminate a favored item from your "Favorites" roster, simply interact with the red "cross" icon positioned at the upper right corner of the respective favorite entry.

6. Observe the chosen favorite being successfully withdrawn from your favorites inventory.
